# Advent of Code 2021

Advent of code is an annual advent calendar and competion. Each day a new challenge is created, it contains a problem that you must solve though programming. However, you can use any programming language you want. I decided to try out solving all of these problems in COBOL this year. 

As these are supposed to be solved in 10 minutes or less, the code can be very sloppy, but it works.
